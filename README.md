The population of vehicles has doubled over the past 20 years and with it did time that people spend stuck in traﬃc. The rate of growth of cars suggests that the problem of congestions is going to get only worse over the years. This project uses a “cellular automaton” model, which focuses on the motion of individual vehicles, to investigate the behaviour of traﬃc ﬂow and provide potential solutions. Research on traﬃc ﬂow distributions in single-lane model led to the conclusion that the probability of breaking is a more signiﬁcant factor in contributing to the maximum traﬃc ﬂow than speed limit. Analysing the two-lane model showed that the ability to change lanes does not impact the maximum traﬃc ﬂow suﬃciently and when the maximum traﬃc ﬂow distributions of both models were compared, the values were within the uncertainties of each other. Implying, that the construction of wider roads can only increase the capacity of cars, but not the traﬃc ﬂow per lane.
